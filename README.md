===============================

This is a simple game where you must get the player to the water without running into any enemy bugs.

You use the arrow keys (up, down, right & left) to move your player.  If you hit an enemy, you'll
have to start over again.  Once you make it safely to the water, you have won the game and it will reset
after a short celebratory pause so you can play again.

This is a fun and easy game that anyone will enjoy.
